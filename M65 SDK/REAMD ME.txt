Note:
-------
By default, the program in \SDK\custom\ is compiled. If you want to comiple other example, you need to change the right value of variable "C_PREDEF" in \SDK\make\gcc\gcc_makefile. This veriable defines the preprocessor definition that includes all codes to compile and link.

For example, if you want to compile the example example_call.c, you first need to redefine the variable "C_PREDEF=-D  __EXAMPLE_CALL__". And then you may "make clean/new" to compile this example.
